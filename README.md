# Summer-Project

There are three branches named by: MAM, Euler-Lagrange and Hamiltonian, which are correspondingly the codes for the Minimum Action Method, the Fourth-Order Euler-Lagrange Method
and the Hamiltonian Optimal Control Method.

In MAM, the comparison part is all included in the main.m file. If you want to compute only the MAM result or the Monte Carlo simulation result, please use four_dimensionMAM and
four_dimensionSDE respectively.

In E-L and Hamiltonian, I have included the codes for both the roll single degree of freedom model and the heave roll coupled model.
